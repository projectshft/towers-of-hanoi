    <h1>Must haves of the game</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a map function to accomplish the 2D board of the game</li>
      <li>
        There should be an object responsible for maintaining the state of the
        board.
      </li>
      <li>There should be a way to move discs from one peg to another.</li>
      <li>
        There should be a checkWinner function that checks to see if the player
        has won the game. You win the game by putting all the discs back in the
        original order but on a new peg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once a player wins, the game should automatically end by announcing the
        winner (through a console log) and reset for a new game.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a bonus, any time you iterate through an array, try and refrain from
        using for or while loops - instead try to use the Array helper methods.
      </li>
    </ul>
