      <h2>The game is played in the console. Here are the instructions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Right mouse click and select inspect</li>
        <li>
          Select how many discs to play with (must be at least 3) using the
          command 'let game = TowerOfHanoi(#)' with the number of discs
          replacing the '#''
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the command game.moveDisc(peg1, peg2) to move disc from peg1 to
          peg2
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Example: game.moveDisc(1, 3) will move a disc from the first peg to
            the third peg
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          The game ends when all disc are moved to either the second or third
          peg
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
        There is only one true rule: a larger disc cannot be moved onto a
        smaller disc. Disc sizes are represented by numbers in the console
      </h3>
